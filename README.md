# Network Security Engineering Labs

## Overview
This repository contains documented hands-on labs focused on **enterprise networking and network security engineering**.  
It demonstrates the design, configuration, and implementation of secure network infrastructures using industry-standard networking and security principles.

The labs are designed to reflect real-world enterprise environments and emphasize security, segmentation, access control, and resilience.

---

## Scope of Work
The repository covers practical implementations of the following technologies and concepts:

### Network Security
- Access Control Lists (ACLs)
- Firewall configuration and policy enforcement
- Network segmentation and traffic control

### Routing and Switching
- OSPF routing protocol configuration
- VLAN design and segmentation
- Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) implementation

### Identity and Access Management
- AAA (Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting)
- Secure administrative access to network devices

### Enterprise Network Architecture
- Network Address Translation (NAT)
- Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) design and deployment
- Secure enterprise network architecture and implementation
